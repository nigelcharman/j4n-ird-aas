This is a fork of [Katrina Clokie's AAS style](https://katrinatester.blogspot.co.nz/2017/05/three-styles-of-automation.html) example automation for a simple IRD calculator.

The spec has been changed to use Markdown and refactored to use a [3-layer approach](http://assurity.co.nz/community/big-thoughts/acceptance-criteria-part-1-seeing-the-wood-and-some-trees/).

It has also been updated to run with later versions of the dependencies.

## Running the example

1. Download and install [GeckoDriver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases)
2. Clone or download this repository, and `cd` to the directory where it was installed
3. Run `./gradlew test` on Unix or `.\gradlew test` on Windows
